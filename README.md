All information regarding the features and dataset can be found in this research arcticle:
Impact of HbA1c Measurement on Hospital Readmission Rates: Analysis of 70,000 Clinical Database Patient Records

I have a family history of diabetes so I want to know how different features affect diabetes in general.
For this kernel, we will be using a diabetes readmission dataset to explore the different frameworks for model explainability


Machine learning models that can be used in the medical field should be interpretable.
Humans should know why these models decided on a conclusion.
The problem is the more complex an ML model gets the less interpretable it gets.
In this kernel we will examine techniques and frameworks in interpreting ML models.
